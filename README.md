The goal of the experiment is to use various GenAI techniques to analyse FMCG products images, answer the questions concerning those images, create image captions and generate images.

Examples created using Google Cloud Vertex AI platform and Imagen APIs.

With Imagen, you can do the following:

Generate images using a text prompt (text-to-image generation).
Edit an entire uploaded or generated image with a text prompt.
Edit only parts of an uploaded or generated image using a mask area you define.
Upscale existing, generated, or edited images.
Fine-tune a model with a specific subject (item) for image generation.
Get text descriptions of images with visual captioning (the model takes in an image as input and produces one or more text descriptions of the image as output).
Get answers to a question about an image with Visual Question Answering (VQA) (the model takes in an image and a question as input, and then using the image as context to produce one or more answers to the question).
